<protasis wn_only="hexagram.n.01, line.n.04, unbroken.a.01">The first hexagram is made up of six unbroken lines.</protasis> <apodosis wn_only="line.n.04, power.n.01, light.n.02, activity.n.01, strength.n.01, spirit.n.01">These unbroken lines stand for the primal power, which is light-giving, active, strong, and of the spirit.</apodosis> <protasis wn_only="hexagram.n.01, strength.n.01, character.n.03, weakness.n.01">The hexagram is consistently strong in character, and since it is without weakness,</protasis> <apodosis wn_only="kernel.n.02, power.n.01, energy.n.01">its essence is power or energy.</apodosis> <protasis wn_only="hexagram.n.01, image.n.01">Its image is heaven.</protasis> <apodosis wn_only="energy.n.01, motion.n.03">Its energy is represented as unrestricted by any fixed conditions in space and is therefore conceived of as motion.</apodosis> <protasis wn_only="time.n.01, motion.n.03">Time is regarded as the basis of this motion.</protasis> <apodosis wn_only="hexagram.n.01, power.n.01, time.n.01, duration.n.01">Thus the hexagram includes also the power of time and the power of persisting in time, that is, duration.</apodosis> <protasis wn_only="power.n.01, hexagram.n.01, sense.n.03, action.n.01, universe.n.01, world.n.01, man.n.01">The power represented by the hexagram is to be interpreted in a dual sense in terms of its action on the universe and of its action on the world of men.</protasis> <apodosis wn_only="universe.n.01, hexagram.n.01, action.n.01, deity.n.01">In relation to the universe, the hexagram expresses the strong, creative action of the Deity.</apodosis> <apodosis wn_only="world.n.01, man.n.01, hexagram.n.01, action.n.01, sage.n.01, ruler.n.01, leader.n.01, power.n.01, nature.n.01">In relation to the human world, it denotes the creative action of the holy man or sage, of the ruler or leader of men, who through his power awakens and develops their higher nature.</apodosis>


THE JUDGMENT

<protasis wn_only="creativity.n.01, work.n.01, sublimity.n.01, success.n.01">THE CREATIVE works sublime success</protasis>, <apodosis wn_only="advancement.n.01, perseverance.n.01">Furthering through perseverance</apodosis>.

According to the original meaning, the attributes <protasis wn_only="sublimity.n.01, potentiality.n.01, success.n.03, power.n.01, advancement.n.01, perseverance.n.01">[sublimity, potentiality of success, power to further, perseverance]</protasis> are paired. <apodosis wn_only="person.n.01, drawing.n.01, oracle.n.02, meaning.n.01, success.n.03, universe.n.01, happiness.n.01, perseverance.n.01, morality.n.01">When an individual draws this oracle, it means that success will come to him from the primal depths of the universe and that everything depends upon his seeking his happiness and that of others in one way only, that is, by perseverance in what is right.</apodosis> The specific meanings of the four attributes became the subject of speculation at an early date. The Chinese word here rendered by "sublime" means literally "head," "origin," "great." This is why Confucius says in explaining it: <protasis wn_only="greatness.n.01, generative_power.n.01, creativity.n.01, being.n.01, beginning.n.01">Great indeed is the generating power of the Creative; all beings owe their beginning to it.</protasis> <apodosis wn_only="power.n.01, permeation.n.01, heaven.n.01">This power permeates all heaven.</apodosis> For this attribute inheres in the other three as well. <protasis wn_only="beginning.n.01, thing.n.12, form.n.01, idea.n.01, reality.n.01">The beginning of all things lies still in the beyond in the form of ideas that have yet to become real.</protasis> But <apodosis wn_only="creativity.n.01, power.n.01, form.n.01, archetype.n.01, idea.n.01">the Creative furthermore has power to lend form to these archetypes of ideas.</apodosis> This is indicated in the word success, and the process is represented by an image from nature: <protasis wn_only="cloud.n.02, passage.n.03, rain.n.01, work.n.01, being.n.01, flow.n.01, form.n.01">"The clouds pass and the rain does its work, and all individual beings flow into their forms."</protasis> Applies to the human world, these attributes show the great man the way to notable success: <protasis wn_only="sight.n.05, clarity.n.01, cause.n.01, effect.n.01, completion.n.01, step.n.01, time.n.05, mounting.n.02, heaven.n.01, time.n.05, dragon.n.01">“Because he sees with great clarity and cause and effects, he completes the six steps at the right time and mounts toward heaven on them at the right time, as though on six dragons.”</protasis> The six steps are the six different positions given in the hexagram, which are represented later by the dragon symbol. Here it is shown that <apodosis wn_only="way.n.02, success.n.03, apprehension.n.02, actuality.n.02, way.n.04, universe.n.01, law.n.01, end.n.04, beginning.n.01, phenomenon.n.01, time.n.01">the way to success lies in apprehending and giving actuality to the way of the universe [Tao], which, as a law running through end and beginning, brings about all phenomena in time.</apodosis> Thus <apodosis wn_only="step.n.01, attainment.n.01, preparation.n.01">each step attained forthwith becomes a preparation for the next.</apodosis> <apodosis wn_only="time.n.01, hindrance.n.01, means.n.01, actuality.n.01, potentiality.n.01">Time is no longer a hindrance but the means of making actual what is potential.</apodosis> <protasis wn_only="act.n.02, creation.n.01, expression.n.02, attribute.n.02, sublimity.n.01, success.n.03">The act of creation having found expression in the two attributes sublimity and success</protasis>, <apodosis wn_only="work.n.01, preservation.n.02, actualization.n.02, differentiation.n.03, form.n.01">the work of conservation is shown to be a continuous actualization and differentiation of form.</apodosis> This is expressed in the two terms <protasis wn_only="advancement.n.01, creation.n.01, accordance.n.01, nature.n.01, being.n.01">“furthering” (literally, “creating that which accords with the nature of a given being”)</protasis> and <protasis wn_only="perseverance.n.01, correctness.n.01, firmness.n.01">“persevering” (literally, “correct and firm”).</protasis> <protasis wn_only="course.n.01, creativity.n.01, alteration.n.01, shape.n.02, being.n.01, attainment.n.01, truth.n.01, specificity.n.01, nature.n.01">“The course of the Creative alters and shapes beings until each attains its true, specific nature</protasis>, <apodosis wn_only="conformity.n.01, great_harmony.n.01">then it keeps them in conformity with the Great Harmony.</apodosis> <apodosis wn_only="demonstration.n.02, advancement.n.01, perseverance.n.01">Thus does it show itself to further through perseverance.”</apodosis> In relation to the human sphere, this shows how <apodosis wn_only="man.n.01, peace.n.01, security.n.01, world.n.01, activity.n.01, creation.n.01, order.n.01">the great man brings peace and security to the world through his activity in creating order</apodosis>: <protasis wn_only="tower.v.01, multitude.n.01, being.n.01, land.n.04, union.n.01, peace.n.01">"He towers high above the multitude of beings, and all lands are united in peace."</protasis> Another line of speculation goes still further in separating the words “sublime,” “success,” “furthering,” “perseverance,” and parallels them with the four cardinal virtues in humanity. To sublimity, which, as the fundamental principle, embraces all the other attributes, it links love. To the attribute success are linked the morals, which regulate and organize expressions of love and thereby make them successful. The attribute furthering is correlated with justice, which creates the conditions in which each receives that which accords with his being, that which is due him and which constitutes his happiness. The attribute perseverance is correlated with wisdom, which discerns the immutable laws of all that happens and can therefore bring about enduring conditions. These speculations, already broached in the commentary called Wên Yen , later formed the bridge connecting the philosophy of the “five stages (elements) of change,” as laid down in the Book of History (Shu Ching) with the philosophy of the Book of Changes, which is based solely on the polarity of positive and negative principles. In the course of time this combination of the two systems of thought opened the way for an increasingly intricate number symbolism.


THE IMAGE

<protasis wn_only="motion.n.06, heaven.n.01">The movement of heaven</protasis> <apodosis wn_only="power.n.01">is full of power</apodosis>.
Thus <apodosis wn_only="man.n.01, strength.n.01">the superior man makes himself strong</apodosis> and
<apodosis wn_only="man.n.01, indefatigability.n.01">untiring</apodosis>.

Since <protasis wn_only="heaven.n.01, unity.n.01">there is only one heaven</protasis>, <apodosis wn_only="trigram.n.01, doubling.n.02, heaven.n.01, image.n.01">the doubling of the trigram Ch’ien, of which heaven is the image</apodosis>, <apodosis wn_only="motion.n.06, heaven.n.01">indicates the movement of heaven</apodosis>. <protasis wn_only="revolution.n.02, heaven.n.01, day.n.01">One complete revolution of heaven makes a day</protasis>, and <apodosis wn_only="trigram.n.01, repetition.n.02, day.n.01, sequence.n.01">the repetition of the trigram means that each day is followed by another</apodosis>. This <apodosis wn_only="time.n.05, idea.n.01">creates the idea of time</apodosis>. Since <protasis wn_only="heaven.n.01, motion.n.06, power.n.01, indefatigability.n.01">it is the same heaven moving with untiring power</protasis>, <apodosis wn_only="time.n.05, duration.n.03, idea.n.01">there is also created the idea of duration both in and beyond time</apodosis>, <apodosis wn_only="motion.n.06, cessation.n.01">a movement that never stops nor slackens</apodosis>, <apodosis wn_only="day.n.01, sequence.n.01">just as one day follows another in an unending course</apodosis>. <protasis wn_only="time.n.05, duration.n.03, image.n.01, power.n.01">This duration in time is the image of the power inherent in the Creative</protasis>. <protasis wn_only="image.n.01, model.n.02">With this image as a model</protasis>, <apodosis wn_only="sage.n.01, development.n.01">the sage learns how best to develop himself</apodosis> so that <apodosis wn_only="influence.n.01, duration.n.03">his influence may endure</apodosis>. <apodosis wn_only="strength.n.01">He must make himself strong in every way</apodosis>, <apodosis wn_only="rejection.n.01, inferiority.n.01, degradation.n.01">by consciously casting out all that is inferior and degrading</apodosis>. Thus <apodosis wn_only="indefatigability.n.01, limitation.n.01, field.n.01, activity.n.01">he attains that tirelessness which depends upon consciously limiting the fields of his activity</apodosis>.

In the hexagram of heaven the doubling of the trigram implies duration in time, but in the hexagram of earth the doubling connotes the solidity and extension in space by virtue of which the earth is able to carry and preserve all things that live and move upon it.</protasis>

Yet nothing remains unfurthered.</apodosis>

<apodosis wn_only="blood.n.01, black.n.01, yellow.n.01">Their blood is black and yellow</apodosis>.

In the top place the dark element should yield to the light. If it attempts to maintain a position to which it is not entitled and to rule instead of serving, it draws down upon itself the anger of the strong. A struggle ensues in which it is overthrown, with injury, however, to both sides. The dragon, symbol of heaven, comes to fight the false dragon that symbolized the inflation of the earth principle. <apodosis wn_only="midnight.n.01, blue.n.01, color.n.01, heaven.n.01">Midnight blue is the color of heaven</apodosis>; <apodosis wn_only="yellow.n.01, color.n.01, earth.n.01">yellow is the color of earth</apodosis>. Therefore, when <protasis wn_only="black.n.01, yellow.n.01, blood.n.01, flow.n.01">black and yellow blood flow</protasis>, it is <apodosis wn_only="sign.n.02, contest.n.01, unnaturalness.n.01, injury.n.01">a sign that in this unnatural contest both primal powers suffer injury</apodosis>.

When all the lines are sixes, it means:

<apodosis wn_only="perseverance.n.01, duration.n.01">Lasting perseverance furthers</apodosis>.

When <protasis wn_only="six.n.01">nothing but sixes appears</protasis>, <apodosis wn_only="hexagram.n.01, change.n.01">the hexagram of THE RECEPTIVE changes into the hexagram of THE CREATIVE</apodosis>. By <protasis wn_only="holding.n.01, rightness.n.01">holding fast to what is right</protasis>, it gains <apodosis wn_only="power.n.01, endurance.n.01">the power of enduring</apodosis>. There is indeed no advance, but neither is there retrogression.

<apodosis wn_only="return.n.01">Hence he comes back</apodosis>.

While the preceding line shows the official compelled by duty to follow the way of danger, this line shows the man who must act as <apodosis wn_only="father.n.01, family.n.01, head.n.01, kinship.n.01">father of a family or as head of his kin</apodosis>. <protasis wn_only="plunge.n.01, danger.n.01, recklessness.n.01, uselessness.n.01">If he were to plunge recklessly in to danger, it would be a useless act</protasis>, <apodosis wn_only="trust.n.01, care.n.01">because those entrusted to his care cannot get along by themselves</apodosis>.

<protasis wn_only="obstruction.n.02">In the midst of the greatest obstructions</protasis>,
<apodosis wn_only="friend.n.01, arrival.n.01">Friends come</apodosis>.

Here we see a man who is called to help in an emergency. He should not seek to evade the obstructions, no matter how dangerously they pile up before him. But because he is really called to the task, the power of his spirit is strong enough to attract helpers whom he can effectively organize, so that through the well-directed co-operation of all participants the obstruction is overcome.


Six at the top means:

<protasis wn_only="travel.n.01, obstruction.n.02">Going leads to obstructions</protasis>,

<apodosis wn_only="benefit.n.01, man.n.01">It furthers one to see the great man</apodosis>.

This refers to a man who has already left the world and its tumult behind him. When the time of obstructions arrives, it might seem that the simplest thing for him to do would be to turn his back upon the world and take refuge in the beyond. But this road is barred to him. He must not seek his own salvation and abandon the world to its adversity. Duty calls him back once more into the turmoil of life. Precisely because of his experience and inner freedom, he is able to create something both great and complete that brings good fortune. And it is favorable to see the great man in alliance with whom one can achieve the work of rescue.
